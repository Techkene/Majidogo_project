# Maji Ndogo Water Source Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing water sources in **Maji Ndogo** using SQL. The primary goal was to clean, organize, and analyze water source data to draw actionable insights for operational improvement.

##  Project Overview

The data collected from various water points in Maji Ndogo was analyzed to:

- Identify which employees visited specific water sources.
- Determine water sources with the **highest queue times**.
- Detect water sources with **broken taps**.
- Clean and correct errors made by the data entry team.

All analysis and data cleaning tasks were performed using **MySQL Workbench**.

##  Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench** – For querying and managing the database.
- **SQL** – Core language used for data analysis and transformation.

##  SQL Concepts Used

We utilized various SQL techniques throughout the analysis:

- `SELECT` statements – To extract specific data.
- `WHERE` clauses – For filtering rows based on conditions.
- `GROUP BY` – To group data and perform aggregations.
- `LIKE` – For pattern matching, especially in text-based searches.
- `AS` – For aliasing columns to improve readability.

##  Data Cleaning

We created a dedicated database to:

- Correct inconsistencies from the data entry process.
- Remove or update incorrect or duplicate entries.
- Structure the data into clean, analyzable tables.

##  Insights

- Mapped each **employee** to the **water sources** they visited.
- Highlighted **bottlenecks** by analyzing queue times.
- Identified **non-functional** water sources (e.g., broken taps) for repair prioritization.
